# EANA

The educational attentiveness analyzer

### Vision
   The one stop solution to make online classes a success.
   As work from home is becoming is a widespread culture, technology
can make the process easier. This project works to make remote working easier and more effective.

   
   
### Why?
As work from home is a widespread culture there is an urgent need for institutions to maintain productivity and take care of the focus levels of students for better understanding and take out most of this in current times. So it has been observed that students attending online lectures often get distracted easily which hampers the learning process . So some solution is required to assess the overall situation.

### Possible use-cases
It solves problems at 4-levels
At the government, education administration, teachers/professors and the student level.

Government: the government is looking for ways to shift education to online platforms due to the pandemic situation. As a result of this, many platforms have emerged which provide interaction between teachers and students. Though online teaching culture is gaining widespread attention, they are not infallible and the government is giving out surveys to validate the effectiveness of these tools. EANA possesses the capability of coupling with any of these platforms and providing an accurate analysis of student/teacher engagement.

education administration: It becomes difficult for the administration like schools, colleges,etc to have an unbiased feedback of the students for the faculty. This leads to incompetence, posing threat to the quality of education. Our product is capable of taking the attentiveness statistics of the whole class and using mathematical calculations to analyse the effectiveness of a faculty. For example, let’s say we calculate the average attentiveness for the whole class and if it is low, we can conclude that either the faculty is not putting enough effort or his/her pedagogy is a bit screwed. Accordingly, further actions can be taken.

Teaching faculty: Virtually, it becomes impossible for the faculty members to track every student. Although it doesn’t affect other students’ performance, it certainly results in casual behaviour and short attention span of students. Using this tool faculty members can see reports of individual students and their performance during the lecture. Consistently poor performing students can be identified and necessary actions maybe taken.

Students: Due to the incompetence of the teachers, the students are at the major loss.  
Taking the statistics of the class as a whole the teaching faculty can be assessed
